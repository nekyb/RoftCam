# information

RoftCam is a program developed in Python that allows you to access a computer's camera through its IP and the activated client.

# How to use? :>

First you have to activate the server.py on your computer and then the client.py on another computer, and on the server it will give you an IP which you have to put in the client and there the remote camera connection is created

# What libraries use?

Generally sockets and OpenCV for connection and access to the camera, and for its design it uses Colorama

# instalation 

Yeah, here I leave you the installation commands :D

Step 1

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nekyb/RoftCam.git
```

Step 2

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 3

Activate the server on your computer

```bash
python server.py
```

Step 4

Activate client.py on the other computer

```bash
python client.py
```

Step 5

Enter the IP in the client that appears on the server.

### And that's it!

But... this is my first python script :), it would help me a lot if you contributed :D
